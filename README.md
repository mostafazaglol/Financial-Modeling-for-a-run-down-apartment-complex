Streit is interested in buying this property because they believe they can renovate it and make it one of the best places to live in Downtown Detroit. Before Streit buys it, they must review the financial information and determine if it's a good investment.

We look at some details like : 
Net Potential Rent, Vacancy, Delinquency, Repairs & Maintenance, Turn Expenses, Utilities(Vacancy), Salaries, Property(Purchase) Sale and Renovations.

After this we calculate : 
1) Rental income is strictly related to collecting rent from tenants.
2) Operating expenses are any expenses related to running the day-to-day operations of the business.
3) Net operating income (NOI) is the income leftover after paying all expenses related to running the day-to-day operations of the business.
4) Capital expenditures are any expenses related to acquiring or renovating the property.
5) Net income is the income left over after all expenses have been paid. This is also the profit for the period.
6) Real estate investors rely on the capitalization rate, or cap rate for short, to calculate their yield on the investment.
7) Return on investment (ROI) is a fundamental profitability ratio that describes how much profit each dollar invested produced.
